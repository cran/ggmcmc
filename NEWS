Version 0.4
------------------------------

MAJOR CHANGES

- Add the possibility to use different parameter names than the default ones
  provided by the MCMC software, using the argument "par_labels" in ggs().

- Move from reshape() to reshape2().

- geom_histogram() allows to specify a desired number of bins.

- ROC plot (ggs_rocplot()) with code originally from Zachary M. Jones.

- Separation plot (ggs_separation()) with code originally from Zachary M. Jones.

- New plots ggs_ppmean() and ggs_ppsd() for posterior predictive checks.

- Make parallel=FALSE the default in ggs().

- Consistency in names of the arguments achieved by moving all "." into "_".

MINOR CHANGES

- rstan is no more a suggested package, because it is not in CRAN, and it is
  not expected to be there in the near future.

- Fix bugs in ggs_crosscorrelation when the number of parameters was 1 or 2.

- In ggmcmc, do not plot Potential Scale Reduction Factor when there is a
  single chain.

- Allow NULL as filename for the pdf file in ggmcmc.

- argument "labels" in ggs_caterpillar() is renamed to "model_labols" avoid
  confusion with the parameter names

- Adjust the defaults for the caterpillar plots, to remark the thick and thin
  segments


Version 0.3
------------------------------

MAJOR CHANGES

- ggs() can import MCMCpack objects, stanfit objects and csv files from Stan
  running from the command line, in addition to the previous import of samples
  from mcmc.list() objects (from the coda package).

- New functions ggs_Rhat() and ggs_geweke() that show graphically the results
  of the Rhat (potential scale reduction factor, by Gelman & Rubin), and the
  Geweke diagnostic (z-score).

- ggs_caterpillar is able to plot against a continuous variable due to the
  addition of the 'X' argument

- ggs_caterpillar() has the ability to plot two models, so that model
  comparison is easier. Thanks to Zachary M. Jones.

- New parameter "family" that allows to select only certain parameters from
  the ggs object based on a regular expression (i.e., select all "beta"
  parameters, or all "theta", ones, or "alpha\\[1,.\\]", etc...)

MINOR CHANGES

- Traceplot now shows by default the burnin period and takes care of the
  thinning, used by ggs_traceplot() and ggs_running().

- New argument to have absolute colour scale in crosscorrelations.

- ggs_caterpillar() is horizontal by default.

- Documentation has been improved.


Version 0.2
------------------------------

MINOR CHANGES

- opts() is replaced by theme() as it is deprecated in ggplot-0.9.2.

- theme_text() is replaced by element_text() as it is deprecated in
  ggplot-0.9.2.

- opts(title="") is replaced by labs(title="") as it is deprecated in
  ggplot-0.9.2.
