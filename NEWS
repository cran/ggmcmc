Version 0.3
------------------------------

MAJOR CHANGES

 - ggs() can import MCMCpack objects, stanfit objects and csv files from Stan
   running from the command line, in addition to the previous import of samples
   from mcmc.list() objects (from the coda package).

 - New functions ggs_Rhat() and ggs_geweke() that show graphically the results
   of the Rhat (potential scale reduction factor, by Gelman & Rubin), and the
   Geweke diagnostic (z-score).

 - ggs_caterpillar is able to plot against a continuous variable due to the
   addition of the 'X' argument

 - ggs_caterpillar() has the ability to plot two models, so that model
   comparison is easier. Thanks to Zachary M. Jones.

 - New parameter "family" that allows to select only certain parameters from
   the ggs object based on a regular expression (i.e., select all "beta"
   parameters, or all "theta", ones, or "alpha\\[1,.\\]", etc...)

MINOR CHANGES

 - Traceplot now shows by default the burnin period and takes care of the
   thinning, used by ggs_traceplot() and ggs_running().

 - New argument to have absolute colour scale in crosscorrelations.

 - ggs_caterpillar() is horizontal by default.

 - Documentation has been improved.
