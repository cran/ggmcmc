#' Graphical tools for analyzing Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations from Bayesian inference.
#'
#' ggmcmc is a tool for assessing and diagnosing convergence of
#' Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, as well as for graphically display
#' results from full MCMC analysis. The package also facilitates the graphical
#' interpretation of models by providing flexible functions to plot the
#' results against observed variables.
