\title{Subset a ggs object to get only the parameters with a given regular expression.}
\usage{
  get_family(D, family = NA)
}
\arguments{
  \item{D}{Data frame with the data arranged and ready to
  be used by the rest of the ggmcmc functions. The
  dataframe has four columns, namely: Iteration, Parameter,
  value and Chain, and seven attributes: nChains,
  nParameters, nIterations, nBurnin, nThin, description and
  parallel.}

  \item{family}{Name of the family of parameters to plot,
  as given by a character vector or a regular expression. A
  family of parameters is considered to be any group of
  parameters with the same name but different numerical
  value between square brackets (as beta[1], beta[2],
  etc).}
}
\value{
  D Data frame that is a subset of the given D dataset.
}
\description{
  Internal function used by the graphical functions to get
  only some of the parameters that follow a given regular
  expression.
