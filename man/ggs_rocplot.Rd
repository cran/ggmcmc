\title{Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) plot for models with binary outcomes}
\usage{
  ggs_rocplot(D, outcome, fully.bayesian = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{D}{Data frame whith the simulations. Notice that
  only the posterior outcomes are needed, and so either the
  previous call to ggs() should have limited the family of
  parameters to pass to the predicted outcomes.}

  \item{outcome}{vector (or matrix or array) containing the
  observed outcome variable. Currently only a vector is
  supported.}

  \item{fully.bayesian}{logical, false by default. When not
  fully Bayesian, it uses the median of the predictions for
  each observation by iteration. When TRUE the function
  plots as many ROC curves as iterations. It uses a a lot
  of CPU and needs more memory. Use it with caution.}
