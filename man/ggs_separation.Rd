\title{Separation plot for models with binary response variables}
\usage{
ggs_separation(D, outcome, minimalist = FALSE, show_labels = FALSE,
  uncertainty_band = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{Data frame whith the simulations. Notice that only the fitted / expected posterior outcomes are needed, and so either the previous call to ggs() should have limited the family of parameters to only pass the fitted / expected values. See the example below.}

\item{outcome}{vector (or matrix or array) containing the observed outcome variable. Currently only a vector is supported.}

\item{minimalist}{logical, FALSE by default. It returns a minimalistic version of the figure with the bare minimum elements, suitable for being used inline as suggested by Greenhill, Ward and Sacks citing Tufte.}

\item{show_labels}{logical, FALSE by default. If TRUE it adds the Parameter as the label of the case in the x-axis.}

\item{uncertainty_band}{logical, TRUE by default. If FALSE it removes the uncertainty band on the predicted values.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object
}
\description{
Plot a separation plot with the results of the model against a binary response variable.

\examples{
data(binary)
ggs_separation(ggs(s.binary, family="mu"), outcome=y.binary)
